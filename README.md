# Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) for highschool kids

This project is a Jupyter notebook to understand FFT. Target audience: highschool kids

I saw a very interesting FFT algorithm explanation YouTube video by "[**Reducible**](https://www.youtube.com/c/Reducible)"

## [The Fast Fourier Transform (FFT): Most Ingenious Algorithm Ever?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7apO7q16V0)

The above video assumes only the following math topics:

1. Polynomials
2. Complex Numbers
3. Matrices

Knowledge of a programming language is useful as well.

I think this explanation can be understood by a class XII CBSE student (equivalent to US high school senior year). The math requirements are covered by the syllabus. Python is taught as the programming language for "Computer Science" course as well. If you're little rusty with Python and need a quick refresher, you may want to check my **[CBSE Class XII Python tutorial](https://github.com/sundararajana/CBSE_XII_Python)**

This Jupyter notebook is an attempt to connect relevant stuff so that a class XII student can attempt the fun of understanding FFT.

### Open [FFT for highschool kids with nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/sundararajana/fft_for_highschool/blob/master/fft_for_highschool.ipynb)

### Open [FFT for highschool kids with Google colab](https://githubtocolab.com/sundararajana/fft_for_highschool/blob/master/fft_for_highschool.ipynb)

## What is Jupyter notebook?

The [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) is an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents
that contain live code, equations, visualizations and narrative text.

## Do I have to install any software on my machine to make use of this project?

No. You can just click on the hyperlink above and read input/output of each Python expression/statement

If you want to edit & play with the expressions/statements, then you've two options:

1. Click on any of the Jupyter notebook in Github. Change the domain from 'github.com' to 'githubtocolab.com'.
The notebook will open in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com). You can login with your google id to edit/play
with it.

2. You can choose to install Python and Jypyter notebook on your machine.

I recommend [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual). After you install Anaconda, you can then download
the zip of this project or git clone this project to play with it on your local machine.
